# General Instructions

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.

## File Management
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User

## Command File Creation
- Creating new command files in `claude/commands/` is generally acceptable when explicitly requested
- ATM commands and other workflow automation files serve legitimate productivity purposes
- Always follow existing naming conventions and file structure when creating commands
